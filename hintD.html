  <h2>The liquid that is already in the chamber is drawn from the chamber, through the stem and actuator, and dispenses out of the pump and onto the userâ€™s hand</h2>
  <h5 class="text-success">Correct.</h5>
  <p>When users press down on the actuator, the piston moves to compress the spring and the upward air pressure draws the ball down. And the ball blocks the pathway of air to run below. While the volume of chamber reduce, the air pressure in the chamber increase.
  </p>
    <p class="text-success">To keep the balance, the air escape from the actuator, enabling air pressure to come back to normal atmospheric pressure level, and the soap in the chamber is also draw up.
