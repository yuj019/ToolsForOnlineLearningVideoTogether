  <h2>The liquid in the bottle is pushed by some mechanism directly and enters in to the tube</h2>
  <h5 class="text-danger">Incorrect</h5>
  <p>A common misconception is that when pressing actuator, people may think some mechanical devices in the pump compress the liquid in to tube and draw it up.
  </p>
    <p class="text-danger">However, the mechanism does not work on liquid directly, in fact, the spring in the chamber changes its volume, along with inner air pressure. And the air pressure pushes liquid into tube and up to the chamber, and actuator finally.
